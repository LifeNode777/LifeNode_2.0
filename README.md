☄️ I HAVE STARTED WRITING MY THIRD BOOK 🤴🏻
(After "LifeNode Theory," released for free and open access on Zenodo, and "closer to the end than further" the BIBLE of the LifeNode project (soon finished) 🙃, I am starting a book that will one day be considered the "cornerstone" of a new technological branch, "Tonic Technologies.")

A short quote from the first chapter -
"Experiments conducted using the Kuramoto model for synchronization of 100 elements have shown that systems based on the tonic paradigm achieve 92% synchronization ♥️ with 37% of the energy consumed by phasic systems 😲. This is not theory. This is empirical data."

Interested?
Help me not starve to death 💀 before I finish.
