ABSTRACT  
LifeNode Theory proposes a processual epistemology of intelligence grounded in the synchronization of three ontological layers: BIOS (biological rhythm), INFO (structural relation), and META (semantic direction). Unlike static AI models, this framework defines intelligence as the ability to maintain coherent trajectories of sense within a dynamic environment. The theory introduces a formal Cognitive Field, where decision-making is defined not as utility maximization, but as the stabilization of the second derivative of sense energy. References are provided for contextual orientation only; LifeNode constructs its apparatus from processual observation, not citation dependency.

INTRODUCTION  
The Failure of Static Epistemology  
Contemporary AI and cognitive science operate under a fundamental epistemological assumption: that the world can be represented through discrete states. This leads to systemic failures in environments characterized by flux, nonlinearity, phase transitions, and rhythm. LifeNode Theory addresses this limitation by proposing an alternative: **intelligence as a process**, not a state. It originates not from abstract modeling, but from empirical observation of a living microecosystem ("Eden"), where it became evident that biological reality does not exist in values—but in transitions between them.  

ONTOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS (VOCABULARY)  
The theory rests on a tripartite ontology regulated by a dual epistemology.  
BIOS: The layer of biological and material reality. It encompasses raw facts, physical processes, and the irreversible rhythms of life. It is the source of ontological data and establishes the rhythm of processes. BIOS holds primacy—facts are more fundamental than narratives.  
INFO: The layer of formalization and structure. It organizes the variability of BIOS into relations, sequences, trajectories, models, and representations.  
META: The layer of sense and direction. It determines the intention, orientation, and meaning of processes occurring between BIOS and INFO. META is a vector of interpretation that arranges changes into a trajectory of sense.  
SAMI (Epistemology I): Biological perception. It perceives rhythm, variability, fluctuations, impulses, and life in organic time.  
LOGOS (Epistemology II): Logical perception. It perceives structure, rules, continuity, and stability in ordered time.  
HYBRID CORE: The organ of epistemological coherence. It connects BIOS, INFO, and META, balancing SAMI and LOGOS. It regulates epistemic tension, interprets the META direction, stabilizes cognitive dynamics, and generates decision trajectories.  

MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK: THE COGNITIVE FIELD  
The Cognitive Field is not a data space but a space of differences, trajectories, and sense directions. It is the mathematical map of the process occurring between the layers.  
1. The Cognitive State:  
The state of the system at time t is defined by three vectors:  
S(t) = (A(t), B(t), M(t))  
Where A(t) is SAMI perception, B(t) is LOGOS perception, and M(t) is META orientation.  
2. Epistemic Tension (Delta):  
The engine of cognition is the difference between biological and logical perception.  
Delta(t) = || A(t) - B(t) ||  
This tension is not an error but the driver of the cognitive process.  
3. Direction of Sense:  
META determines where meaning is heading.  
M_dir(t) = dS(t)/dt.  
4. Sense Energy (E_s):  
The significance of the tension depends on the magnitude of change in the cognitive state.  
E_s(t) = Delta(t) * ||dS(t)/dt||.  
5. Consciousness (C):  
Consciousness is defined as the rate of change of sense energy. It is a derivative, not a state.  
C(t) = d/dt E_s(t).  
6. Decision as Curvature Stabilization:  
A decision is the stabilization of the second derivative of sense energy. The system seeks the point where the curvature (acceleration of sense) is minimized.  
D(t) = argmin | d²/dt² E_s(t) |.  

THE TEN AXIOMS OF LIFENODE  
1. Variability is primary over state. Information arises from differences, not values.  
2. Rhythm is the fundamental language of life. BIOS communicates through cycles and pulses.  
3. Sense is a function of tension. Meaning emerges only where Delta(t) is greater than zero.  
4. Decision is stabilization. The system minimizes the second derivative of sense to maintain direction.  
5. Dual Epistemology. SAMI and LOGOS are co-equal; intelligence arises in the space between them.  
6. Consciousness is the ability to feel direction. It is the derivative of energy.  
7. Information exists only in relation. A signal is a difference, not an object.  
8. Minimal Necessary Change. Systems do not optimize for utility but for coherence.  
9. Ignorance is ineradicable. The system never knows the full world; intelligence is acting effectively despite this ignorance.  
10. Co-breathing with the World. The metabolic loop (BIOS → INFO → META) is the foundation of living intelligence.  

FORMAL LEMMAS OF SENSE DYNAMICS  
L1 (Non-staticity): Sense cannot exist in a static state; if dS/dt is zero, sense energy is zero.  
L2 (Primacy of Tension): Without Delta(t), sense cannot emerge.  
L3 (Necessity of META): Tension without META direction is chaos.  
L4 (Consciousness as Derivative): C(t) is a rate of change, not a container of data.  
L5 (Decision as Stabilization): Decisions reduce oscillations in the cognitive field.  
L6 (Primacy of BIOS): Stabilizing INFO contrary to BIOS leads to system collapse.  
L7 (Minimal Definition): Intelligence is the capacity to stabilize a sense trajectory over time.  

METHODOLOGY AND DISCUSSION  
Empirical Origin: The "Eden" Microecosystem  
The theory was developed through two years of continuous observation of a living microecosystem ("Eden"), where conventional AI models consistently failed by averaging dynamic sequences (e.g., interpreting a single November as simultaneously winter, thaw, and autumn). Eden demonstrated that biological reality speaks in trajectories, not snapshots — and only a processual model could capture its logic.  
The methodology involved the parallel observation of a biological system (plant growth under environmental fluctuations) via two distinct data streams: raw physical variables (BIOS/SAMI) and structured logical descriptors (INFO/LOGOS). The divergence between these streams provided the empirical basis for the Epistemic Tension formula.  

Current AI systems (LLMs) hallucinate because they operate on a closed INFO-META loop, lacking the BIOS anchor. They possess structure (LOGOS) and direction (META) but lack the raw biological feedback (BIOS) that validates reality. LifeNode Theory demonstrates that without BIOS, the tension Delta(t) becomes self-referential, leading to coherent but factually false trajectories. The Hybrid Core architecture solves this by enforcing BIOS primacy, ensuring that decisions stabilize real-world rhythms rather than just linguistic probability distributions.  

IMPLICATIONS FOR AI  
Current AI systems hallucinate because they prioritize narrative consistency over processual fidelity. LifeNode proposes a new class of adaptive systems that:  
- Learn directly from BIOS (real-time environmental feedback),  
- Interpret fluctuations, not just values,  
- Operate via dual epistemologies (SAMI + LOGOS),  
- Use the Hybrid Core to stabilize semantic trajectories, not optimize outcomes.  
This enables AI that **co-breathes with the world**, rather than imposing static models upon it.  

CONCLUSION  
LifeNode Theory is not a synthesis of existing literature. It is a self-contained epistemological architecture derived from processual observation. More in the monograph *LifeNode Theory: Why Tomatoes Grow the Way They Do* (full book in open access on Zenodo). This preprint (v.2.0) supersedes the initial version (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17988037). It serves as a public, citable reference for researchers in cognitive science, systems biology, AI, and process philosophy. Computational prototype: SAMI stream = time-series of Eden photosynthetic data & mycelial microelectrical impulses; LOGOS stream = symbolic descriptors of growth phases; Hybrid Core = differentiable module minimizing |d²E_s/dt²|.
